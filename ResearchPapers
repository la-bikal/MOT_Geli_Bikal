Possible Multi-Object Trackers:

1)	Furnish face detector [Haar classifiers]
2)	Object Tracker 
  a.	Research past work [4 each]
  b.	Brainstorm all of the ideas and algorithms found out in lit review
  c.	Pick 3 legit ideas, talk to the professor
3)	We have to find a way to include metrics, how many FPs? How many FNs? Etc. To be able to benchmark
4)	Latex [Abstract, Introduction, Some equations, algorithms] â€“ share the project with Geli in overleaf


TO Dos until Sunday:
1) Try to make haar cascades as good as possible
2) Implement Lucas Kanade Optical Flow
3) Have the overall layout and some content ready for Overleaf [:]
4) If time permits, look for more papers for lit review / ML based is fine || 
5) If time permits, be on the lookout for more trackers.
